# AlgoritOmis
My Java practice, diverse algorithms

(I) initialized but need develop, (M) medium, you can test it but need to be finished, (F) finished, full develop

# Classes:

* (F) StringCodify: a simple way to encrypt and encode strings, with stochastic compression about 70 Â± 5 %

* (M) AwtTriangulo: a simple AWT example, to calculate trianle angles, and draw it, but it need to be draw yet.

* (F) SimpleLocalCRUD: a simple practice of command line algorithmia to register students and their notes, in a local array.

# Usage:
you can see, edit and use this, mainly with academyc purposes, always given credits, but keep calm with monetary purposes
